## About

As the name suggests, this app focuses on recurring expenses like rent, insurance, subscriptions, and other regular payments.
Built with Kotlin Multiplatform and Material You design principles, it provides a simple yet powerful way to track and visualize your recurring financial commitments.
The app is designed to be intuitive and straightforward, helping you understand exactly where your money goes each month.
My idea is to add new features iteratively, and I'm happy for any contribution. Feel free to make feature requests or report bugs if you find any.

- Your total shows **net available funds** after all recurring expenses
- Income and expenses in one unified view
- Clear picture of your monthly financial situation

**Example:** Monthly Salary `-3000` + Rent `1200` + Insurance `150` = `-1650` available

### iOS
The app compiles for iOS and works fine, but I do not have an Apple developer account to publish it. That's why it can only be used when compiled locally. Let me know if you have an idea how to solve this problem without paying a $99 annual fee to Apple.

### Desktop platforms (Windows, Linux and macOS)
The app compiles and works for all 3 desktop OS platforms. I'll look into how to publish a version for those platforms in the future.
